PayPal recommends using your own `client_id` and `secret` from the [Developer Dashboard](https://www.paypal.com/signin?intent=developer&returnUri=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.paypal.com%2Fdeveloper%2Fapplication) by entering the values under the **Variables** tab. A pre-request script will generate and manage the `access_token` automatically.\n\n> **Note:** Your developer account `client_id` and `secret` may have a different scope than the default `client_id` and `secret`.\n\n## Step 3: Make your first API call\n\nPayPal recommends starting with the Orders API. These steps will use the Orders API to create an order and capture payment using [sandbox accounts](https://developer.paypal.com/developer/accounts) linked to your Developer Dashboard account.\n\nTo create an order:\n\n1. In your workspace, navigate to your fork of the PayPal collection.\n1. Select **Orders > Create Order**.\n1. Select the **Send** button to create the order. On a successful call, the API returns a 201 order created response code.\n1. In the response, find the **approve** link.\n1. Open the **approve** link in a browser.\n1. Log in with your Developer Dashboard Sandbox Personal Account credentials. You can find those credentials by logging into the Developer Dashboard and selecting **Sandbox > Account**\n1. Select the **Continue** button. Payment has now been made.\n\nTo capture payment:\n\n1. In the response of the order you created, find the `order_id`.\n1. In the **Variables** tab, enter the `order_id` number.\n1. Select **Orders > Capture payment for order**.\n1. Select **Send**. On a successful call, the API returns a 201 order created response code.\n\nYour order has been created and payment has been captured. You can verify the transaction in both the sandbox personal account and the sandbox business account.\n\n![Buyer Payment Verification](https://www.paypalobjects.com/devdoc/transaction-details-buyer.png)\n![Seller Payment Verification](https://www.paypalobjects.com/devdoc/transaction-details-seller.png)",

To provide evidence or appeal a dispute, you submit a proof of delivery or proof of refund document or notes, which can include logs.<br/><br/>Normally, an agent at PayPal creates a dispute, updates the dispute status, and settles disputes, but now you can run test cases in the sandbox that complete these operations.<br/><br/><blockquote><strong>Important:</strong> The create, cancel, compute metrics, change reason, and validate eligibility methods are available as a limited-release solution at this time.
